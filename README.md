# Soccer Mod - 2019 Edit
An edited Version of Marco Boogers SourceMod plugin aimed at Counter-Strike:Source soccer servers.  
I merely edited and added stuff without any prior knowledge, so expect some heavily improvable code.  

### If you used a previous (edited) version of soccermod:  
  ‚óè Remove "exec soccer_mod.cfg" and any soccer_mod_* command from your server.cfg  
  ‚óè Remove the file "soccer_mod.cfg" from your cstrike/cfg folder  
  ‚óè Remove / Move shortsprint.smx and duckjumpblocker.smx to the disabled folder  
  ‚óè (OPTIONAL) Copy the contents of the old soccermod created files (addons/sourcemod/config and /data) to the new ones (created after the plugin loaded) in cfg/sm_soccermod  
  ‚óè (OPTIONAL) Remove SoccerMod only admins from admins_simple.ini and add them to the new SoccerMod admin file. (SteamID and Name required)

  ‚óè Duckjump Script by Marco Boogers  
  ‚óè Allchat (aka DeadChat) by Frenzzy - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=171734
