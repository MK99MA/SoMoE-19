# [So]ccer [Mo]d [E]dit [-] [2019] (Current Version: 1.3.7.1 | Latest Tested Version: 1.3.5.1)  

An edited Version of Marco Boogers SourceMod plugin aimed at Counter-Strike:Source soccer servers.  
I merely edited and added stuff without any prior knowledge, so expect some heavily improvable code.  
  
  
## Credits:
I incorporated parts of the following plugins and only modified them partially to my needs or in a way so they would fit all into one plugin file. Therefore almost all credit should go to:

Could be used to force cstrike to cache its grass texture right after starting. Theoretically obsolete since 1.3.2 and the addition of server-sided grass replacer options but can still be used for servers not using it or if you prefer to disable the replacer and use this method. Alternatively you can just 'Create a Server' with the following map right after starting up CS:S:
