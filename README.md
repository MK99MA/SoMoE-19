# [So]ccer [Mo]d [E]dit [-] [2019] (Current Version: 1.2.8)  

An edited Version of Marco Boogers SourceMod plugin aimed at Counter-Strike:Source soccer servers.  
I merely edited and added stuff without any prior knowledge, so expect some heavily improvable code.  
  
  
## Credits:
I incorporated parts of the following plugins and only modified them partially to my needs or in a way so they would fit all into one plugin file. Therefore almost all credit should go to:
