# Soccer Mod - 2019 Edit
An edited Version of Marco Boogers SourceMod plugin aimed at Counter-Strike:Source soccer servers.  
I merely edited and added stuff without any prior knowledge, so expect some heavily improvable code.  

### If you used a previous (edited) version of soccermod:  
  ● Remove "exec soccer_mod.cfg" and any soccer_mod_* command from your server.cfg  
  ● Remove the file "soccer_mod.cfg" from your cstrike/cfg folder  
  ● Remove / Move shortsprint.smx and duckjumpblocker.smx to the disabled folder  
  ● (OPTIONAL) Copy the contents of the old soccermod created files (addons/sourcemod/config and /data) to the new ones (created after the plugin loaded) in cfg/sm_soccermod  
  ● (OPTIONAL) Remove SoccerMod only admins from admins_simple.ini and add them to the new SoccerMod admin file. (SteamID and Name required)  

## [>>DOWNLOAD<< Please still read all the information below](https://github.com/MK99MA/soccermod-2019edit/blob/master/README.md#installation)  
  
## Credits:
I incorporated parts of the following plugins and only modified them partially to my needs or in a way so they would fit all into one plugin file. Therefore almost all credit should go to:  
  ● Original version by Marco Boogers - https://github.com/marcoboogers/soccermod  
  ● Duckjump Script by Marco Boogers  
  ● Allchat (aka DeadChat) by Frenzzy - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=171734  
  ● ShortSprint by walmar - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2294299  
Not included in soccer_mod.smx but relied on:  
  ● Updater by GoD-Tony - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=169095  
  
## Example Changes
