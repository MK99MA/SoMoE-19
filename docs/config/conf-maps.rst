===========================
soccer_mod_allowed_maps.cfg
===========================

**soccer_mod_allowed_maps.cfg** is the config storing a list of maps. If the plugin detects that the currently running map is listed in this config, all aspects of SoMoE-19 will be usable. If you notice that certain parts of the plugin are not working, make sure to check if the currently running map allows SoMoE-19.
In addition to that, every map listed in this file will be added to the mapchange menu of SoMoE-19.

	.. attention:: You can add any map the plugin can find on the server to the file using an ingame menu.
