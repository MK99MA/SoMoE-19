This version of SoMoE-19 is just an edited version of Marco Boogers original `Soccermod <https://github.com/marcoboogers/soccermod>`_. I merely edited his plugin by adding stuff I thought to be useful or fixing parts that were not working as intended. This version of his plugin is also strictly **limited to Counter-Strike: Source** and unlike his version does not work for Counter-Strike Global Offensive.

Since I started working on my own version without any prior knowledge in SourcePawn the code might be messy and improvable, but for now I merely attempted to provide a functional release.

Some of the functions added to the plugin are based on or incorporated from other plugins:

 - `Soccermod <https://github.com/marcoboogers/soccermod>`_ by Marco Boogers
 - Duckjump block script by Marco Boogers
