This submenu can be used to change certain client settings resolving around the sprinting feature. It also features a short informational text, but is mostly used to enable or disable certain sprinting indicators such as:

 - Messages - Displays a chat message when you are sprinting, sprint ended or you can sprint again.
 - Progress Bar - Displays the defuse bar as a visual indicator for the sprint duration or cooldown.
 - Sound - Plays a sound when you activate sprint.
 - Timer - Adds a customizable numeric timer to your HUD. 
 
The **Timer** also allows a range of customization. The position of the Timer is freely changeable and can be changed in the **Timer Settings** submenu. In this submenu is also another submenu called **Color** to freely adjust the timers color.
The Option *Display timer* can be used to constantly display the timer while editing its color and position.
