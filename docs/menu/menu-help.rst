The help submenu is kind of an ingame equvivalent of this documentation and features a commands list with a short description. It also features a printable url to the official SoccerMod steamgroup page as well as this documentation (starting from 1.2.8).

Please note that the linked steamgroup is Marco Boogers original group and provides information about his original plugin.
